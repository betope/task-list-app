# Task List App
 A task list app created using only Javascript.
 
 My english isn't so good as well cause I'm also learning English.
 
 This app was created using only Javascript. And I'm still learning it so I begin to make this project to put in practice what I've learned so far. 
 
This project is almost complete, I just need to learn how to save the created tasks using localStorage, Then the app can be used,
Currently if you create a task and reload the page the info will be deleted.
